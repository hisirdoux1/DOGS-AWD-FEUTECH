                        <p>The Rottweiler is a large, muscular dog breed with an iconic appearance that is known for its strength and loyalty. Originating from the town of Rottweil in Germany, they have a history dating back to the Roman Empire, where they were used as herding and guarding dogs. Today, Rottweilers are renowned for their versatility and serve as exceptional working dogs, excelling in roles such as police work, search and rescue, and service dogs. They are characterized by their strong build, with a broad head, well-developed muscles, and a distinctive black and tan coat that is short and dense.</p>
